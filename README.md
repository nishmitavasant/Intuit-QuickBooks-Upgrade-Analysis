# Intuit QuickBooks Upgrade Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aimed to develop a predictive model to identify small businesses likely to respond to an offer to upgrade to QuickBooks version 3.0. Utilizing data from a wave-1 mailing campaign, our goal was to maximize the effectiveness of Intuit's wave-2 mailing campaign. Advanced predictive modeling techniques, including Logistic Regression and Neural Networks, were employed to analyze business interactions, purchasing history, and prior campaign responses.

## Objective
The primary objective was to refine the selection process for the wave-2 mailing, aiming to increase response rates and maximize the campaignâ€™s overall effectiveness and profitability. This involved evaluating different classifiers, performing extensive hyperparameter tuning, and enhancing model accuracy.

## Key Results
- The optimized logistic regression model achieved an AUC of 0.755, demonstrating strong predictive capability.
- The targeted mailing strategy reached 303,949 businesses, resulting in 25,225 positive responses.
- Generated a projected profit of $1,084,932, with a Return on Marketing Expenditure (ROME) of 253.15%.
- This project won a competition among our MSBA class cohort by achieving the highest profit based on actual campaign responses.
